# hackpalachia-project
Project written at Hackpalachia 2023
# Objective
We saw a disconnect between the healthcare resources and students at Ohio University, so we engineered an application to tackle this problem and promote the availability, awareness, and access of healthcare resources in Athens county and for Ohio University Students.
# What does it do?
This application has several features. First, it has the map and search bar, this allows you to search for specific items and find where they are physically located on campus. For example, the access of free tampons on campus is not campus wide, so you could look up tampons and figure out which bathrooms on campus have tampons. Or you could look up a variety of other resources such as emergency facilities, mental health facilities, and much more. The next feature in our app is the variety of links on the app which serve as a hub for the online resources Ohio University already has publicly available, and links to other important information. Finally, the last feature on the application is the bot. This bot will send healthcare availability updates and also serve as an emergency interface if someone would like to reach out to an Ohio University staff member for help by texting "help" to the bot.
